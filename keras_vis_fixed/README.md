# keras-vis

I do not claim any credit whatsoever for the keras-vis python library. The original was made by user raghakot, and I simply edited certain files to make it compatible with our research (compatability with custom structures found in the Emotions in The Wild model). Instead of forking the libarary, I included it in this repository in order to make it work out of the box. The original library can be found at: https://github.com/raghakot/keras-vis/
